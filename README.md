# Tower of Hanoi Solver with Visualization

## Project Description
A Tower of Hanoi solver using recursion, visualized using Pygame.

## Features
- Recursive solution for the Tower of Hanoi problem.  
- Real-time visualization using Pygame.  
- Adjustable number of disks.  

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.11 or later.  
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## How It Works
- The rods and disks are represented as a list of lists.
- The recursive function tower_of_hanoi moves disks between rods, updating their positions.
- Pygame is used to visually represent each move.

## Usage
1. Adjust the number of disks by changing the num_disks variable in the main function.
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
